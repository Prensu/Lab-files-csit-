🌐 Introduction to Servlets and JSP
✅ What are Servlets?
Java classes that run on the server and extend the capabilities of web servers.

Handle HTTP requests and send responses to clients (typically browsers).

Platform-independent and provide a robust mechanism for server-side web development.

Act as controllers in MVC architecture.

✅ What is JSP (JavaServer Pages)?
JSP allows Java code to be embedded within HTML.

Facilitates the creation of dynamic web content based on:

User input

Database queries

Business logic

Easier for designers and developers to work with because of its HTML-like structure.

🔄 Servlet and JSP Workflow
Servlet: Handles business logic and request processing.

JSP: Manages presentation logic and renders HTML.

Together they support a Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern.
